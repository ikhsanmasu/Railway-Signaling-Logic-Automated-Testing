This project is purposed to automate the testing process of railway signaling logic. 
The logic is created using a Function Block Diagram on PLC hardware. 
The idea is to communicate the Automated Testing Software with PLC using Modbus communication so we can perform specific tasks by writing the Modbus slave address on PLC and recording the response by reading the Modbus slave address.
after that, we can compare with the result and write it down in the Excel format file.
